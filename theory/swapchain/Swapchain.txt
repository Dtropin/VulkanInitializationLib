Swapchains are a mechanism by which the rendering of the drawing primitive is shown on
a platform-specific presentation window/surface. A swapchain may contain single or
multiple drawing images. These drawing images are called color images. A color image is
simply an array of pixel information that resides in a special layout in the memory

When double images are used, it's called double buffering, and when three surfaces are used,
triple buffering.

Among these images, when one image completes the drawing process in the background, it
is swapped to the presentation window. In order to fully utilize the GPU, a different image
is then treated as a background buffer for the drawing process

The swapping or flipping of the drawing image is dependent upon the presentation mode;
this may be updated during the Vertical Blanking Interval (VBI) or as soon as the drawing
is made available. This means that when the monitor is refreshed, the background image is
swapped with the front image displaying the new image
