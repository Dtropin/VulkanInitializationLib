1) Create empty native platworm window that will be connected to swapchain

2) Query swapchain extensions. Swapchain not part of Vulkan and it is platform dependent,
so vulkan has only interfaces(function pointers) predefined in
vulkan specification, and vendors must implement this spec. Then in app we link Vulkan Api(function pointers) to implementation
of swapchain api

3) Create surface and associate it with created window. It Creates a logical platform-specific surface object.

4) Getting supported image formats.

5) Get swapchain image surface capabilities

6) Set present mode

7) Use above gathered info and create swapchain images (VkImage)

8) Create VkImageView to grant access to images
